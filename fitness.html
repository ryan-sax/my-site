This page is under development.
<p>
Not entirely sure what I'll post in here yet.
<p>
I'll probably talk more about my training in here eventually (but does anyone care about that?)
Maybe I'll talk about past fitness adventures (like biking through Europe).
<p>
Well, for now I'm training for a half Ironman on June 17th.
Hopefully my bike crash from May 20th doesn't get in the way of that!
No real injuries luckily, just some pretty bad road rash.
These showers have been some of the msot painful experiences of my life.
Will never take a good shower for granted again. Ha!
And it requres a break from the pool. 
<p>
Now enjoy a picture of me from a triathlon a couple years ago (you're lucky it's not a pciture of the road rash):
