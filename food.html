We'll see what happens here.
<p>
I may post some of the food I'm making, food I'm eating, products I'm loving (like Might Mill bread, shoutout Justin Mares).
Who knows.
<p>
My recent food addiction though: cottage cheese with Manuka honey.
So good.
I grew up despising cottage cheese and had never had Manuka honey.
Tried them both recetnly and now I'm in love with this tasty high protein snack.
<p>
Alright, that's all for now. We'll see what comes of this page.
