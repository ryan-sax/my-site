<h2>Podcasts</h2>
<p>
I am a huge podcast fan.
<p>
My friends and family think I'm crazy and I'm sure are sick of all my podcast recommendations.
It all started with Tim Ferriss' podcast.
It introduced me to the world of podcasts, to entrepreneurship, and to so many fascinating people who's rabbit holes I went down.
<p>
Here are my current favorite podcasts.
<ul>
<li>Acquired (recent favorite episodes on Walmart, Amazon, Benchmark Capital)</li>
<li>Tim Ferriss (the OG, what got me interetsed in podcasts/entrepreneusrhip in the first place - favorite recent episodes incldue Derek Sivers, Ed Throp, Kevin Kelly)</li>
<li>Huberman Lab</li>
<li>The Drive by Peter Attia</li>
<li>My First Million (how I found out about TrueMed when Justin was on!)</li>
<li>Limited Supply (always talking about Justin and Kettle & Fire - great opportunity for TrueMed!)</li>
<li>Founders</li>
<li>All-In</li>
<li>DNVR Nuggets Podcast (staying up to date on my Nuggets during their championship run)</li>
</ul>
I'm always open to new podcast recs, and more than happy to give one!
