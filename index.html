And now here's some basic info about me and some work I have done.
I am always learning and looking to gain new experience (like making this website from scratch).
<p>
I loved the scrappy medical device startup in San Diego (with occasional surf breaks with the boss) where I was a design engineer intern. I worked with amazing people there who are still mentors to this day.
<p>
As an innovation intern at Under Armour I worked to make gear that would help athletes (everyone) perform their best.
<p>
I realized that although I loved learning engineering, numbers, and the problem solving skills I gained, it was time to apply myself elsewhere. That's what led me to management consulting.
<p>
I was always drawn to business and entrepreneurship, this was my chance to break into business and hone my skills! I've learned a lot, worked on many interesting projects, and met many great people.
<p>
Now it's just time for me to go and make a true difference. Follow my mission and make an impact helping a company grow and follow its vision.
