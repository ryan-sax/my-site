<p>
I've been fortunate to do a decent amount of traveling abroad.
<p>
From studying abroad in Madrid (it changed me, as everyone says) and all the weekend trips then.
<p>
To biking through Switzerland and France (with some stormy days in the Alps)
<p>
To my solo trip all throughout Italy
<p>
I've been fortunate.
In the future, I'm going to blog my travels on here.
SE Asia here I come!
